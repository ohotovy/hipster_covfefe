Coding Bootcamp Prague - hackathon 1


Hey, Pete,

I can't believe you've sent the request on Friday. Like wth, after all these years of working together? You know there are no devs in the office on Friday. It's just two temps who were literally hired two weeks ago... to make coffee for the actual devs.

Man, you suck!
